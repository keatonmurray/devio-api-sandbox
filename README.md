# 🚧 Devio Admin Panel Sandbox

**The modern admin panel for Devio — an open-source headless CMS built for speed, structure, and scalability.**

Welcome to the Devio Admin Panel Sandbox — an experimental playground for the Devio admin interface. This is an **open-source subproject** of [Devio CMS](https://github.com/keatonmurray/devio-api-sandbox) and serves as the central dashboard for content creators, developers, and teams using Devio to build fast, modern headless applications.

## ✨ Why This Exists

While most headless CMSs provide content modeling, they stop short when it comes to **backend logic** like forms, carts, workflows, and authentication. Devio fills this gap with a **plugin-first backend** — and this sandbox is where we build and test the admin interface that powers it all.

Think:

* **Drag-and-drop block-based UI**
* **Schema-driven content modeling**
* **Plugin-powered backend workflows**
* **Instant preview and deploy-ready frontends**

This project is your entry point to shaping how headless CMS admin panels **should work** in 2025 and beyond.
